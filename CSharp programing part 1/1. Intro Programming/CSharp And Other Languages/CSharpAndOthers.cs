         * С# е съвременен език с общо предназначение.
         * C# (pronounced see sharp) is a multi-paradigm programming language 
         * encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional,
         * procedural, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and 
         * component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by
         * Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a 
         * standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2006). 
         * C# is one of the programming languages designed for the 
         * Common Language Infrastructure. C# is intended to be a simple, 
         * modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
         * Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg. 
         * The most recent version is C# 5.0, which was released
         * on August 15, 2012.
         * 
         * Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines 
         * a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both
         * human-readable and machine-readable.
         * 
         * Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) is a declarative
         * XML-based language created by Microsoft that is used for
         * initializing structured values and objects.
         * Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed 
         * using a more traditional .NET language, such as C# or Visual Basic.NET.
         * 
         * SQL (Structured Query Language) е специализиран език за
         * за работа с бази данни.
         * SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language
         * designed for managing data held in a relational database management
         * systems (RDBMS). Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple 
         * relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition language and a data
         * manipulation language.
         * 
         * HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the main markup language
         * for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed
         * in a web browser.
         * 
         * Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, 
         * object-oriented computer programming language that is specifically
         * designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
         * It is intended to let application developers 
         * "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code
         * that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled
         * to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled
         * to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
         * regardless of computer architecture.
         * 
         * JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.
         * It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that 
         * client-side scripts could interact with the user, control 
         * the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document
         * content that was displayed.
         * 
         * Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation
         * for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's 
         * lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language
         * for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest
         * programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science,
         * including tree data structures, automatic storage management,
         * dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion,
         * and the self-hosting compiler.
         * 
         * Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages,
         * and remains the most popular among such languages today,
         * with many free and commercial implementations available. 
         * While initially aimed at natural language processing, the
         * language has since then stretched far into other areas like
         * theorem proving, expert systems, games, automated 
         * answering systems, ontologies and sophisticated control systems.
         * Modern Prolog environments support creating graphical user interfaces,
         * as well as administrative and networked applications.
